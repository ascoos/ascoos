# Ascoos Ecosystem

The Ascoos ecosystem is a comprehensive software environment that includes technologies, tools, and applications for Web, IoT, and AI platforms.  
Its goal is to provide modern, efficient, and extensible solutions for developers and organizations seeking high performance, modular architecture, and technological innovation.

This GitHub account hosts ongoing projects, open‑source libraries, and supporting tools that form part of the broader ecosystem.

---

## 🔹 History & Evolution

The development of the Ascoos ecosystem began in 2007–2010 with **Ascoos CMS 10**, the world’s first Windows‑like (Desktop‑like) CMS.  
Ascoos CMS 10 made extensive use of JSON and jQuery at a time when XML‑based technologies and prototype.js dominated the landscape, introducing a pioneering desktop‑like management experience.

The architecture and technological choices of Ascoos CMS 10 laid the foundation for the philosophy behind today’s **Ascoos OS**:  
a low‑level design, modular infrastructure, desktop‑like interfaces, and the ability to serve as a foundation for frameworks, CMS platforms, APIs, and complex applications.

---

## 🔹 The Ascoos Project Family

The ecosystem includes:

- Web Kernels & Framework Foundations  
- Desktop development tools  
- UI Libraries & Markup Languages  
- Hybrid databases  
- WebAI & Web 5.0 technologies  

Each project is designed with:

- modularity,  
- extensibility,  
- high performance,  
- seamless integration into existing infrastructures.

---

## 🔹 Desktop Applications

### **Ascoos Web Extended Studio (AWES)**  
A complete, portable IDE for developing web applications, featuring:

- multiple Web, DB, and FTP servers,  
- integrated tools (editors, browsers, etc.),  
- support for multiple PHP versions,  
- visual management and debugging tools,  
- fully portable operation.

AWES functions as a full development suite rather than a simple server runner.

---

## 🔹 Web Applications & Technologies

Ascoos provides solutions that cover:

- Web 5.0 kernels  
- Visual development environments  
- UI frameworks  
- Hybrid JSON‑SQL databases  
- WebAI infrastructures  

These technologies support modern use cases across Web, IoT, and AI environments.

## 🔹 Main Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [**Ascoos OS**](https://github.com/ascoos/os) | A low‑level **Web5/WebAI Kernel** written in pure PHP, featuring built‑in AI, a Macro Engine (DSL/AST), and technologies such as `CiC`, `OTA`, `DUAL`, and `LibIn`. It serves as a foundation for frameworks, CMS platforms, APIs, IoT systems, and complex applications. |
| [**Ascoos Web Extended Studio (AWES)**](https://github.com/ascoos/awes) | A portable IDE for developing and testing web applications across multiple PHP versions and databases, featuring visual tools and extensibility. |
| [**JML (JSON‑style Markup Language)**](https://github.com/ascoos/jml/blob/main/README.md) | A lightweight markup format inspired by JSON and DSLs, designed for rapid UI template creation in Ascoos OS, with AST support and full UTF‑8 compatibility. |
| [**BootLib**](https://github.com/ascoos/bootlib) | A UI framework with an extensive interface library, powered by the `JAscoos` JavaScript framework. |
| [**JSQLDB**](https://github.com/ascoos/jsqldb) | A hybrid JSON‑SQL database engine focused on speed, modularity, and PHP‑native queries. |
| [**Greek Spellchecker**](https://addons.mozilla.org/el/firefox/addon/greek-spellchecker/) | A Firefox add‑on for Greek spell checking. |
| [**phpBCL**](https://github.com/ascoos/phpbcl) | A PHP compatibility library for older versions. |
| [**WIC (Web Images Cryptography)**](https://github.com/ascoos/wic) | A new image file format (`*.wic`) offering high compression and enhanced security for web use. |
| [**WebAI**](https://github.com/ascoos/WebAI/blob/main/README.md) | An architecture where the web itself operates as an intelligent entity, rather than a collection of AI add‑ons. |

## 🔹 Technological Superiority of Ascoos OS

**Ascoos OS** is not a framework; it is a **low‑level kernel** operating beneath the abstraction layer of modern PHP frameworks.  
The available comparison table highlights the differences between Ascoos OS and popular frameworks, demonstrating its role as a foundational layer upon which frameworks, CMS platforms, and complex applications can be built.

See the [comparison table](https://github.com/ascoos/os/blob/main/COMPARE.md) for more details.
